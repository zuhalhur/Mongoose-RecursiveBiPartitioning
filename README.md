# Mongoose-RecursiveBiPartitioning
You can perform recursive bi-partitioning with the Mongoose library by integrating the changes in the patch file named structure.patch into your structure.cpp in ABCD Solver. Then by selecting partitioning method = 6, you can use our tool for obtaining row-blocks in block Cimmino implementation of ABCD Solver.
